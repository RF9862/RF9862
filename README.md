## üõ†Ô∏è Approach to Development

1. **Modular Design**: I follow a modular, component-based approach, ensuring that the code is reusable, maintainable, and scalable.
2. **Agile Methodologies**: Expertise in Agile and Scrum frameworks. I thrive in environments that value iteration, feedback, and continuous delivery.
3. **Security Best Practices**: Implement security measures like CSRF protection, data validation, and encryption (SSL/TLS, AES) by default.
4. **Testing and QA**: Writing automated unit and integration tests to maintain the code quality and ensure that all features function as expected.
