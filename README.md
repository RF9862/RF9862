### **Core Python Skills:**
- Proficiency in Python syntax, including mastery of data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, along with control flow using loops and conditionals.
- Deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Experience with functional programming paradigms, including map, filter, reduce, and lambdas.
- Strong ability in writing robust code with custom exception handling and debugging techniques.

### **Web Development with Python:**
- Experience building full-stack applications using Flask or Django, including setting up REST APIs, routing, authentication, and templating.
- Understanding of how Python interacts with frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue, and experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Expertise in asynchronous programming using libraries like `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, and `celery` for handling concurrent tasks.

### **Data Science and Machine Learning:**
- Proficient in data manipulation and analysis using libraries like NumPy and Pandas, handling large datasets, and performing data cleaning.
- Experience building and deploying machine learning models using frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- Ability to create visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data analysis and presentation.
- Working knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK and SpaCy, and experience with tasks such as sentiment analysis and tokenization.
- Understanding of deep learning concepts, including neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and experience working on AI projects like image classification and object detection.

### **Automation and Scripting:**
- Experience with web scraping and browser automation tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy.
- Ability to automate repetitive tasks or data workflows using Python scripts, such as automation with cron jobs or Airflow.

### **API and Backend Development:**
- Expertise in building, testing, and maintaining RESTful APIs using Flask/Django or FastAPI, with knowledge of GraphQL as a plus.
- Proficiency with relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Redis) databases, along with experience using ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM.

### **DevOps and Cloud Technologies:**
- Experience with containerization using Docker to containerize Python applications for deployment and testing.
